so essentially im autistic and i dont really care to be super indepth because im probably the only one who will ever use this and atleast I have it working on my end. essentially juyst take the master mode zip and extract it and place it in the yuzu/load/botw folder (botw is placeholder for the product key). for the pack file, because of githubs 25mb upload limit and my laziness and sloth in not wanting to set up github desktop for something so menial extract it, create a "romfs" folder and put the extracted file there, create a "yournamehere" folder and put the new romfs folder in that, then put that folder in the yuzu/load/botw foldrer
